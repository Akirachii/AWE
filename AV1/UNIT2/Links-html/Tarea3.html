    <p><pre>
        I wasn't jealous before we met
        Now every woman I see is a potential threat
        And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
        You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
        But now it isn't true
        Now everything is new
        And all I've learned has overturned
        I beg of you
        Don't go wasting your emotion
        Lay all your love on me
        It was like shooting a sitting duck
        A little small talk, a smile, and baby I was stuck
        I still don't know what you've done with me
        A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
        I feel a kind of fear
        When I don't have you near
        Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
        I beg you, dear
        Don't go wasting your emotion
        Lay all your love on me
        Don't go sharing your devotion
        Lay all your love on me
        I've had a few little love affairs
        They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
        I used to think I was sensible
        It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
        'Cause everything is new
        And everything is you
        And all I've learned has overturned
        What can I do?
        Don't go wasting your emotion
        Lay all your love on me
        Don't go sharing your devotion
        Lay all your love on me
        Don't go wasting your emotion
        Lay all your love on me
        Don't go sharing your devotion
        Lay all your love on me
        Don't go wasting your emotion
        Lay all your love on me

        <p><pre>
            A little wicked
            That's what he calls me
            'Cause that's what I am
            That's what I am
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne
            Beware the patient woman, 'cause this much I know
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne
            One of these days a comin', I'm gonna to take that boy's crown
            There's a serpent in these still waters, lying deep down
            To that king I will bow, at least for now
            One of these days a comin', I'm gonna to take that boy's crown
            'Cause I am, I am
            A little wicked
            I am, yes, I am
            Hands red, hands red
            Just like you said
            I am, a little wicked
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne
            I'll be high up in that tower, he'll be down there getting stoned
            Beware the patient woman, 'cause this much I know
            No one calls you honey when, you're sitting on a throne
            'Cause I am, I am
            A little wicked
            I am, I am
            Hands red, hands red
            Just like you said
            I am, a little wicked
            As I lay me down to sleep
            I will not scream, I will not weep
            If he should die, before he wakes
            I pray the Lord, his soul to take
            'Cause I am, I am
            A little wicked
            I am, yes, I am
            Hands red, hands red
            Just like you said
            I am, I am
            (A little wicked)
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne
            No one calls you honey, when you're sitting on a throne

                I know what you're doin' here
                Made your intentions clear
                Oh you, you terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Beautiful thing
                Honey, you're so cold
                You left me on patrol
                Lose my self-control with you (when I'm with you)
                Do things I don't want to do, ooh
                Oh for you, you terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Beautiful thing
                Hm, you beautiful thing
                A wreck, a wreck you make
                You leave, you leave me in your wake
                Oh honey, let me go
                Aha, aha, don't you let me go
                A wreck, a wreck you make
                You leave, you leave me in your wake
                Oh honey, let me go
                Don't you ever let me go
                Oh honey, you're so cold
                I lose my self-control
                Oh you, you terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Beautiful thing, you
                Beautiful thing, you
                Beautiful thing, you
                Beautiful thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Terrible thing, you
                Beautiful thing
                Oh you, beautiful thing
                You terrible thing
